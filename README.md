# SmartSafe

SmartSafe is a personal security system that gives the user agency in a emergent situation such as an attack.
Once activated it pairs with nearby/ zoned speakers dedicated to the system and sounds an alarm (in the future, will also set
off flashing lights) to serve as a deterrent to the would be attacker. We  believe that this gives the victim the opprotunity 
to get away or will scare the offender off completely.
